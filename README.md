Descanning is the process of removing various quality degradation factors from a scanned image to restore it as close to the original as possible. Scanned images contain special and diverse quality degradation factors, such as halftone patterns, show-through effects, and color fading. The purpose of descanning is to effectively remove these elements to create a clean, restored image.
